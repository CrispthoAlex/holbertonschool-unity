The Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality (AR/VR) specialization focuses on teaches fundamentals of programming in C# and developing interactive mixed reality projects in Unity3D, the worldâ€™s leading real-time game engine. Throughout the next nine months, we will learn Unity3D concepts such as scripting, animation, UI design, creating shaders, game testing, and more, as well as learning UX concepts specific to AR and VR, including accessibility and user comfort. With these skills, weâ€™ll be able to create interactive experiences of all kinds, not only for entertainment or gaming, but industries such as marketing, manufacturing, healthcare, education, and more.

This track will require to download, test, and manually review your peersâ€™ Unity projects. This will give you experience in play testing projects as well as give you insight to other methods of accomplishing the tasks in each project. Much of AR/VR is about designing for optimal user experience, and thereâ€™s no better way to understand what makes a good user experience than testing it for yourself and seeing what works and what doesnâ€™t.
